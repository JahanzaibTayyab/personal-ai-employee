# Quickstart: Bronze Tier Personal AI Employee

**Estimated Setup Time**: 30 minutes

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [ ] Python 3.13+ installed
- [ ] UV package manager installed (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)
- [ ] Claude Code installed with active subscription
- [ ] Obsidian v1.10.6+ installed
- [ ] (Optional) Google Cloud project for Gmail integration

## Step 1: Initialize Project with UV

```bash
# Create new project with src layout (if starting fresh)
uv init --package ai-employee
cd ai-employee

# Or if cloning existing repo
cd personal-ai-employee

# Add dependencies (UV picks latest versions automatically)
uv add watchdog
uv add pyyaml

# Add dev dependencies
uv add --dev pytest pytest-cov ruff

# Add optional Gmail support
uv add google-auth google-api-python-client --optional gmail

# Sync and verify installation
uv sync
uv run python -c "import ai_employee; print('OK')"
```

## Step 2: Create Obsidian Vault

```bash
# Create vault directory (choose your preferred location)
mkdir -p ~/AI_Employee_Vault

# Create required folders
mkdir -p ~/AI_Employee_Vault/{Inbox,Needs_Action,Needs_Action/Email,Done,Drop,Quarantine,Logs}

# Create initial Dashboard.md
cat > ~/AI_Employee_Vault/Dashboard.md << 'EOF'
# AI Employee Dashboard

**Last Updated**: Never

## Status

- **Watcher**: Not started
- **Pending Items**: 0
- **Processed Today**: 0

## Recent Activity

| Time | Action | Item | Result |
|------|--------|------|--------|
| - | - | - | - |

## Warnings

None

*Auto-generated by AI Employee*
EOF

# Create Company Handbook
cat > ~/AI_Employee_Vault/Company_Handbook.md << 'EOF'
# Company Handbook

## Rules

### Rule 1: Priority Keywords
When processing items, check for these keywords and set priority:
- "urgent", "asap", "emergency" → priority: urgent
- "important", "priority" → priority: high

### Rule 2: Large File Handling
Files larger than 10MB should be flagged for manual review.

### Rule 3: Default Behavior
Process all items in order received (FIFO). Log all actions.

## Contact Information

Owner: [Your Name]
EOF
```

## Step 3: Configure Environment

```bash
# Create .env file for configuration (add to .gitignore)
cat > .env << 'EOF'
# AI Employee Configuration
VAULT_PATH=~/AI_Employee_Vault
WATCH_INTERVAL=60

# Optional: Gmail Configuration
# GMAIL_CREDENTIALS_PATH=~/.config/ai-employee/credentials.json
EOF
```

## Step 4: Start the File System Watcher

```bash
# Start the watcher (runs in foreground)
uv run ai-employee watch --vault ~/AI_Employee_Vault

# Or run in background with logging
uv run ai-employee watch --vault ~/AI_Employee_Vault > watcher.log 2>&1 &
```

## Step 5: Test the System

```bash
# Drop a test file into the watch folder
echo "Test content" > ~/AI_Employee_Vault/Drop/test.txt

# Wait 60 seconds, then check Needs_Action
ls ~/AI_Employee_Vault/Needs_Action/
# Should show: FILE_test.txt.md

# Check watcher log
cat ~/AI_Employee_Vault/Logs/watcher_$(date +%Y-%m-%d).log
```

## Step 6: Process Items with Claude Code

```bash
# Open Claude Code in the vault directory
cd ~/AI_Employee_Vault
claude

# Use the process-inbox skill
# Type: /process-inbox

# Or manually ask Claude to process items:
# "Process all files in /Needs_Action according to Company_Handbook.md rules"
```

## Step 7: Install Agent Skills

The following skills are installed in `.claude/skills/`:

| Skill | Command | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| Process Inbox | `/process-inbox` | Process all items in /Needs_Action |
| Update Dashboard | `/update-dashboard` | Refresh Dashboard.md with current status |
| Check Watcher | `/check-watcher-health` | Verify watcher is running |

**Skill Directory Structure**:
```
.claude/skills/
├── process-inbox/
│   └── SKILL.md           # Main skill instructions
├── update-dashboard/
│   └── SKILL.md
└── check-watcher/
    └── SKILL.md
```

**Custom Agents** (optional) in `.claude/agents/`:
- `inbox-processor.md` - Specialized for batch inbox processing
- `watcher-monitor.md` - Health monitoring for watchers

## Verification Checklist

After setup, verify each component:

- [ ] **Vault Structure**: All folders exist in AI_Employee_Vault
- [ ] **Dashboard**: Dashboard.md opens in Obsidian without errors
- [ ] **Watcher**: Dropping a file creates an action item within 60 seconds
- [ ] **Claude Code**: Can read and write files in the vault
- [ ] **Skills**: `/process-inbox` command executes without errors

## Troubleshooting

### Watcher not detecting files

1. Check if watcher process is running: `ps aux | grep ai-employee`
2. Verify vault path is correct in configuration
3. Check watcher log for errors: `tail ~/AI_Employee_Vault/Logs/watcher_*.log`

### Claude Code can't access vault

1. Ensure Claude Code is run from within the vault directory
2. Check file permissions on vault folder
3. Verify CLAUDE.md or project configuration includes vault path

### Gmail Watcher not working

1. Verify OAuth credentials are valid
2. Check token.json exists and is not expired
3. Ensure Gmail API is enabled in Google Cloud Console
4. Check for rate limiting (max 1 request per 2 minutes)

## Next Steps

After completing Bronze tier setup:

1. Customize `Company_Handbook.md` with your rules
2. Test with various file types
3. Monitor Dashboard.md for activity
4. Consider upgrading to Silver tier for Gmail integration
